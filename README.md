## Built With

## Prerequisites
In order to make the program work, you need to have ruby interpreter installed in your system. You can get the latest version of ruby from [official website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).


## Getting Started 

1. clone the project

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/8Bts/Micro-Reddit.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd Micro-Reddit

# make sure you have ruby 2.7.1
# install gems from Gemfile using bundle
$ bundle install

# migrate table to database

$ rails db:migrate

# use rails console to test the app

$ rails console
```
## Usage

_First, you need to create model object_

- `user = User.new`

_Then, you need to set the attributes of the object created_

- `user.username = 'Paul'`
- `user.email = 'paul@gmail.com'`
- `user.age = 22`

_Before you save your object to the actual database, check its validity_

- `user.valid?` (Should return `true` if it is valid)

_Now you can save your object to database_

- `user.save` (This statement will return `false` without saving your object if you have any invalid value)

_Check your records by typing this statement_

- `User.all`

You can follow the same steps for the other model objects included in `app/models/`, to test them.
